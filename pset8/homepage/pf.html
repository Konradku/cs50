            <p class="lead">Pink Floyd grew out of a series of short-lived bands featuring musicians Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals) and Bob Klose (guitars). Klose left in 1965, shortly before the erstwhile group of musicians began calling themselves "The Pink Floyd Sound", which was later shortened to just "Pink Floyd". Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Barrett's deteriorating mental health led his bandmates to invite guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour to join in December 1967, as the group were recording their follow-up album, A Saucerful of Secrets (1968). Barret left the band in April 1968, shortly before the release of the album. The group recorded a number of experimental albums and film soundtracks in the early 1970s, including soundtracks to the films More and Zabriskie Point, the half-live, half-studio double album Ummagumma, and the experimental Atom Heart Mother. This period was marked by the band's heavy use of non-musical sounds and experimental studio techniques known as musique concrète. Their 1971 album Meddle represented an important transitional work as the band became more focused in their songwriting; it was the last album written by the band collaboratively, as Waters emerged as the primary lyricist and thematic leader. Starting with The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), the band released a series of concept albums, each exploring a cohesive theme and narrative flow, that continued with Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards. Waters' increasingly dictatorial control over the group alienated his bandmates. Wright was fired during the production of The Wall, although he was contracted as a session musician for the subsequent tour, and the band continued as a three-piece for their next album, The Final Cut (1983). </p>

                <p clas="card-text">The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. Primarily developed during live performances, the band premiered an early version of the record several months before recording began. The record was conceived as an album that focused on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent mental health problems suffered by former band member Syd Barrett, who departed the group in 1968. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios in London. </p>

                <p clas="card-text">Animals is both a progressive rock album and a concept album, focusing on the social-political conditions of mid-1970s Britain, and was a change from the style of their earlier work. Tension within the band during production culminated in keyboardist Richard Wright being fired two years later. The album's cover shows an inflatable pig floating between two chimneys of Battersea Power Station, conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter Roger Waters, and was designed by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson. The band released no singles from the record, but promoted it through the In the Flesh tour. Waters' agitation with audiences during this tour inspired their next record, The Wall. </p>

                <p clas="card-text">The Wall is the eleventh studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 30 November 1979 by Harvest and Columbia Records. It is a rock opera that explores Pink, a jaded rock star whose eventual self-imposed isolation from society forms a figurative wall. The album was a commercial success, topping the US charts for 15 weeks and reaching number three in the UK. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it overblown and pretentious, but later received accolades as one of the greatest albums of all time and one of the band’s finest works.</p>
